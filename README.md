VBA Challenge

In this assignment, I am looping through all of the rows in column A to get the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume for every ticker  provided. 
The yearly change is formatted to show the negative changes in red and the positive changes in green. 
The Percent change is formatted to percentages.
